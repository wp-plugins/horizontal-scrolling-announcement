I have already created the translation pot file for you. 
horizontal-scrolling-announcement.po

Example: For doing Dutch translation.

Open the above mentioned file in GPL poedit software http://www.poedit.net/.

Enter your Dutch language terms in the poedit software and then save as 
horizontal-scrolling-announcement-nl_NL.po 
and put it in the /languages directory

Now Open up your WordPress wp-config.php file and add the following:

define (‘WPLANG’, ‘nl_NL’);

That's it. Happy coding...
